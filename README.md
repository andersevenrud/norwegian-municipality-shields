# Norwegian Municipality Shields

I was unable to find any online packs complete with SVG municipal shields for Norwegian counties, so I scraped them from Wikipedia.

All of the files are located in `out/` and formatted as `County Name - Municipality Name.svg`.

## Scraping

If you want to re-download all of the files, run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `node index.js`.

This might take a while depending on your connection. There's a concurrency limit to prevent getting blocked.
